/*
*
Functions with a pointer argument must take a pointer
var v Vertex
ScaleFunc(v, 5)  // Compile error!
ScaleFunc(&v, 5) // OK

While methods with pointer receivers take either a value or a pointer as the receiver when they are called
var v Vertex
v.Scale(5)  // OK
p := &v
p.Scale(10) // OK

For the statement v.Scale(5), even though v is a value and not a pointer, the method with the pointer receiver is called automatically.
That is, as a convenience, Go interprets the statement v.Scale(5) as (&v).Scale(5) since the Scale method has a pointer receiver.
